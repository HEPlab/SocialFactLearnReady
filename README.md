# SocialFactLearnReady
This project, Social Factors of Learning Readiness, aims to detect nonconscious social factors, such as student implicit mental representations of their instructors, that affect learning readiness. The first piece of the project is to create continuous control tasks in immersive virtual environments, to use as a substrate for measuring implicit changes in control.

Some of the core assets of this were purchased from private creators through TurboSquid.

More to come!
